# JavaScript_Database

This is a repository in which contains both problem sets and tutorial notes from JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass avaiable in Udemy.
Inside the repository, everything is categorised in different folders where their name originated from the same tutorials from Udemy, more specifically from Colt Steele. The file contains both my individual answers and the model answers provided by the tutor.

Feel free to use it as a reference to see how I solved the problem and what could have bene implemented for better performances. Finally I personally hope this repository to contribute in making a better world to live in. Thank you :)
